# coding-quiz-js

In this weeks challenge, we are tasked to create a timed coding quiz that would use the JavaScript fundamentals to guage progress. The user presses the start button which initiates the timer and is presented with the first of four questions. When the question is answered, the next questio appears. If the user inputs a incorrect answer, the clock deducts ten seconds of time. The questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over and the user can save their initials and score.
